​​JUP AND JUICE seeks Full Work Group status after becoming a Trial in September 2024, establishing itself as Jupiter DAO’s vital grassroots media studio.

The purpose of J&J is to unify and amplify the Jupiverse, connecting the best of Jupiter to the best of crypto.

The problems J&J seek to address is Jupiter's rapid pace leads to information overload, mixed narratives and a fractured user base. Moreover, Jupiter has no marketing department, and the DAO lacks a speaker box. 

J&J uses many tools to address this, providing ambassadorship and showcasing Jupiter alongside crypto’s biggest names. Tools include a podcast, broadcasting DAO events, campaigns and talent acquisition. 

Despite operating on zero production budget, J&J achieved these trial highlights:

- 7.5M impressions
- 405K+ video views
- 9.3K+ organic followers
- 60 podcasts, 200+ videos, 12.4k tweets
- Alliances with; Pudgy Penguins, Star Atlas, BONK, SNS, Huma, Meteora and more.


To scale they request a 1-year budget:

- 282K USDC (246K team, 36K operations)
- 355K JUP (for alignment, locked 1 year)

Sax, Wake, Satchel, and Maneek are fulltime and handle: creative, branding, content, strategy, podcast, video editing, community outreach and more.

The vision is to be a leading crypto media studio, placing the Jupiverse at the center.
