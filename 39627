The **Litterbox Trust** was established earlier this year to receive 50% of Jupiter's onchain revenue and programmatically buy back $JUP. 
The original plan was to increase alignment and build a DAO capital reserve. However, feedback from the community has made it clear that decisive action is necessary to benefit all $JUP holders.

For this reason, the Jupiter DAO will now hold votes on the future of the Litterbox. We need to answer two independent questions:

1. What should be done with the ≈130M $JUP tokens currently in the Litterbox (≈4% of circulating supply)?
2. What should happen with the 50% of onchain revenues sent to the Litterbox in the future?

Today, we begin voting on the **first question** with a simple binary choice: **should we burn the $JUP in the Litterbox, or not?**

Note: ASR for Q4 2025 will remain time-weighted and will not be affected by this vote.
