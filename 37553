<b>Recognizing</b>
- that the Jupiter DAO, having reached the milestone of its first operational year, has emerged as the most active and influential decentralized governance body within the Jupiverse;

<b>Acknowledging</b>
- the critical learnings from its first year of operation, particularly the challenges around scope clarity, voting efficiency, decision-making frameworks, and the limitations of direct democracy in all matters;

<b>Declaring</b>

<b>Hereby:</b>
- Reaffirms that the Jupiter DAO’s core purpose is to accelerate the growth and adoption of Jupiter products, community, and ideas, globally.
- Mandates that all DAO actions should be oriented toward initiatives that increase user adoption of Jupiter products, deepen community engagement, or advance global discourse on the decentralized meta.
- Distinguishes between: The DAO (the legislative arm of the broader Jupiter community, focused on its aforementioned mission) and the Jupiter Team (which focuses on product strategy, business growth, and token utility) 
- Declares a strategic two-year journey of Progressive Independence, during which the DAO will mature into a fully autonomous and self-sustaining governance body, with milestones around proposal generation processes, legal incorporation, operational control of the DAO treasury, funding mechanisms, and transparency. 
- Accepts a renewal of the DAO Treasury to its initial allocation of $10m USDC from the Jupiter team, to be used over the coming 2 years. 
- Designates the DAO as a future recipient of Litterbox Trust funds, subject to achievement of independence criteria.
- Endorses the DAO’s role as a platform for opportunity distribution, not just governance participation, with the ability and desire to compensate talented individuals at market rates for their contributions. 
- Calls Upon the DAO to ratify this resolution as a formal agreement on its mission, operating principles, and funding strategy.
