The Jupiter DAO, in just one year, has emerged as the most active and one of the most influential DAOs in crypto. But we’ve learned many critical lessons that we must address in order to enable the DAO to create massive value for the Jupiter ecosystem. In order to get a broad social mandate on our purpose, distinction from the Team, funding, and journey of progressive independence, we hereby:

<b>Define</b> the Jupiter DAO is the legislative arm of the greater community with the core purpose of accelerating the growth and adoption of Jupiter products, community, and ideas globally. All DAO actions should be oriented towards furthering these specific goals.

<b>Distinguish</b> between The DAO (the legislative arm of the broader Jupiter community, focused on its aforementioned mission) and the Jupiter Team (which has domain over product strategy, business growth, and token utility) 

<b>Declare</b> a strategic two-year journey of Progressive Independence, during which the DAO will mature into a fully autonomous and self-sustaining entity with assistance from the Jupiter Team. 

<b>Accept</b> a renewal of the DAO Treasury to its initial allocation of $10m USDC from the Jupiter team, to be used over the coming 2 years. 

<b>Endorse</b> the DAO’s role as a platform for opportunity distribution, not just governance participation, with the ability to compensate talented individuals at market rates for their contributions. 

<b>Call Upon</b> the DAO to ratify this resolution as a formal agreement on its mission, operating principles, and funding strategy.
