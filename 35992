Over the last year, Jupiter expanded its team from 15 to 80, including known leaders, top tier engineers and great team players to drive the key efforts of JUP.ag, jupiverse and jupnet forward.

This expansion is crucial to growing Jupiter from a simple DeFi protocol into vision we want to achieve.

For the JUP needed for this new set of team members, we could just go with the default and draw it from the Strategic Reserve, but for the purpose of full accountability for this expansion strategy, Meow will like to provide 2 other options where he fronts the required JUP completely.

Since one of the option requires a bonus from the community reserve, we are putting the options up for a vote:

Options:

1.⁠ ⁠Option 1 - Fund with Strategic Reserve (Default): Unlock 280M JUP from the team-managed Strategic Reserve starting July 2025 to give to the new team members, vesting over the course of multiple years.

2.⁠ ⁠Option 2 - Max Long-Term Meow Alignment: Meow funds the JUP needed with his personal allocation of 280M JUP, then reclaims it from Strategic Reserve in 2030 and requests a 220M JUP bonus from the Community Reserve in 2030. In this option, the community can veto the bonus anytime before 2030 if Meow's performance is deemed unsatisfactory. In case of veto, he can reclaim his JUP from the reserve after 2027.

3.⁠ ⁠Option 3 - No Net Emissions + No Bonus: Meow funds the JUP personally and reclaims 280M JUP from the Strategic Reserve in 2027, without any bonus from the Community Reserve

Finally, Jupiter always has a superb track record of consistently investing in the future and having team members and leaders stand by the decisions.

It is also crucial to note that we do not expect such major team expansions to happen again over the next 2-3 years as we are now in the phase of consolidating and shipping.
