The DAWG, popularly known as Jup Design Labs, has spent the past five months addressing Jupiter DAO’s brand fragmentation, design inconsistencies, and the need for structured design support as a DAO grant recipient.

Now, they seek your support to formalize DAWG with a 3-month trial phase focused on:
Developing a cohesive design system for Jupiter DAO  
Providing dedicated design support to Working Groups, Regional Initiatives, and Grantees  
Expanding Jupiter’s promotional assets 
Hosting practical design workshops to equip the community with creative skills  

Their team— Adedamolajoke (Lead), Joiceloo, Kira, and Design Anarchy—brings 25+ years of collective design and mentoring experience to the Jupiverse.  

They are requesting 69,000 USDC for three months to cover operational costs, including team compensation and the community contributor pool.
