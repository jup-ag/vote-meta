Huma Finance is proposing a DAO Alliance With the Jupiter DAO, and to be the first launch on Jupiter's New presale platform, setting a precedent for serious, high-integrity Projects committed to on-chain value creation.

To underline that partnership, the following is proposed:

<b>A) Presale for JUP stakers</b>
1% of total supply of Huma tokens available only to JUP stakers.
The larger the stake, the larger the presale-allocation.
Tokens will be locked for 3 months post-TGE.
Goal: maximize participation from aligned long-term holders.

<b>B) DAO-to-DAO Treasury Swap</b>
Amount: $250K worth of Huma tokens for $250K worth of JUP
Valuation: $75M FDV for Huma tokens
Lockup: 1 year

<b>C) Jupiter Community Activation</b>
We’re requesting collaboration more so than capital.
Help us ensure the Huma launch becomes a true community moment
Propose launch strategies.
Create memes, threads, spaces.
Inject your signature Jupiter vibes into the process.
In return, we commit to building long-term with this community.

<b>Note:</b> You will receive ASR rewards no matter which option you vote for.
