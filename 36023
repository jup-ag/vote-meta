In addition Meow will be doing spaces to answer any questions in around 30 minutes after this vote begins. Please attend it or listen to the recording to understand more about the context around vote.

Here’s the key voting question: Do you want Meow to front the 280M JUP required for the long-term alignment of new team members and lock-in until 2030, in return for a 220M JUP bonus from the Community Reserves?

There are two main options here:

- Yes, meow fronts the 280M JUP and locks in until 2030 in return for a 220M JUP bonus.
- No, the 280M JUP comes from the team's strategic reserve and meow’s JUP unlocks in June 2026 as planned.

Note that in the event that the “Yes” option is successful, the 220M bonus remains veto-able before 2030.

Additionally, you may choose to abstain from the vote.
