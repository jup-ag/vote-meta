Vote on the excess of 215,461,850.21 $JUP unclaimed from the Jupuary airdrop.

There are ~215m excess $JUP tokens that were unclaimed in Jupuary 2024.

We as a community need to decide what should be done with these tokens.

We are proposing three different options to the DAO:

1. Fund 1 more year of ASR with 50M per quarter (rest returned to community mulitisig)
2. Burn the tokens
3. Return the tokens to the community multisig

Note: This is the last vote with ASR Rewards for this quarter, claim your rewards in 2 weeks. Vote to continue this practice for future quarters.
