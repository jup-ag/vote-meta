$JUP is the alignment engine between the team, the community, and token holders. When it wins, we all win. 

This proposal creates a bold alternative path forward for $JUP by reducing net emissions to effectively zero. 

There are two options for this vote: 

Option 1 - Continue with Jupuary: 
Proceed with the planned airdrop schedule. The checker will launch ~1 week after the vote, followed by the initial 200M $JUP distribution, with the remaining bonus pool and Jupnet incentives rolling out as designed. Team vesting and Mercurial vesting continue as scheduled.

Option 2 - Zero Net-New Emissions: 
Postpone Jupuary and return the 700M tokens to the Community Cold Multisig, preserving the initial airdrop snapshot. Pause team token emissions indefinitely, with any liquidity needs absorbed directly by Jupiter's balance sheet. Accelerate Mercurial vesting and offset any sell pressure by purchasing an equivalent amount of $JUP. This package is designed to drive net-new emissions effectively to zero for the foreseeable future.
