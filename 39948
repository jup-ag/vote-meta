$JUP is the alignment engine between the team, the community, and token holders. When it wins, we all win. In response to concerns about emissions in current market conditions, this proposal directly addresses the three primary sources of supply: Jupuary, Team Vesting, and Mercurial stakeholder vesting. 

The goal is simple: To reinforce long-term confidence in $JUP by reducing or eliminating net-new token emissions and reducing uncertainty from near-term emissions.

Option 1 - Continue with Jupuary: Proceed with the planned airdrop schedule. The checker will launch ~1 week after the vote, followed by the initial 200M $JUP distribution, with the remaining bonus pool and Jupnet incentives rolling out as designed. Team vesting and Mercurial vesting continue as scheduled.

Option 2 - Zero Net-New Emissions: Postpone Jupuary and return the 700M tokens to the Community Cold Multisig, preserving the initial airdrop snapshot. Pause team token emissions indefinitely, with any liquidity needs absorbed directly by Jupiter's balance sheet. Accelerate Mercurial vesting and offset any sell pressure by purchasing an equivalent amount of $JUP. This package is designed to drive net-new emissions effectively to zero for the foreseeable future.

This is a high-leverage decision that belongs to the DAO. The team will abide by the outcome. Read the full proposal on discuss.jup.ag.
