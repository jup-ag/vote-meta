Enhance certainty for JUP holders and community via a token supply reduction.

This is the first of the series of three JUP-related votes to help build more certainty among the JUP community and the holder base.

We aim to achieve this certainty by addressing concerns around high FDV, build in a best-in-crypto level of transparency around token distribution and allow the voters to decide the major parts of the potential emissions.

This first vote centres around the 30% token supply reduction as follows:

- Team will voluntarily cut 30% from their assigned allocation
- Corresponding 30% reduction in Jupuary emissions
- The rest of the reductions will come from previously assigned allocations such as from LP and strategic reserves

With the audit, ethos essay and this reduction in supply, we hope the community will emerge from this vote with a much enhanced understanding of the collective plans for JUP and be able to execute towards the meta as one cohesive unit.

Note: The 3B JUP will be burnt over 6 months, more info will be released after the vote is over.
