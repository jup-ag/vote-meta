Vote on Uplinkâ€™s Budget Proposal

Uplink functions as the top of the funnel for the entire Jupiverse, pushing the core narratives from the team, DAO and our partners as widely and loudly as possible, via a community-first approach.

They are asking for a budget of $552,000 and 2.15 million JUP vested over 4 years, with a 1 year cliff.

This will be used to sustain the team of 6, and to provide microgrants to their roster of content creators.
