Vote on funding for Jupiter’s microgrants initiative.

Up until now, the main way to participate in the Work Group System was through Trials.

However, the trial system is intensive and demanding, therefore it is not suitable for small-scoped tasks.

In order to create more opportunities for participation and allow DAO members to demonstrate proof-of-work prior to applying to be a trial working group, the CWG is proposing a budget to fund dozens of microgrants.

This budget consists of $150,000 to exclusively fund roughly 15-30 microgrants to the Jupiter DAO community to better provide support for smaller tasks and potential pre-trial work.

This amount will be used to fund grants up to $10k, with no minimum.

At the end of the period (3-6 months) or if the funds are exhausted, the CWG will hold a retrospective with the community to determine what can be improved for future grants implementations and next steps.

Please, read the full proposal for a detailed breakdown.
