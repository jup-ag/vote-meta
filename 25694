Each DAO vote must reach a minimum threshold, or quorum, to be considered valid.

Currently, this number is set to 60 Million JUP.

We are proposing 2 options to change this threshold:

1. Increase from a fixed 60 Million JUP to a fixed 120 Million JUP.
2. Peg the Quorum to 30%~ of Staked JUP, right before each vote.
