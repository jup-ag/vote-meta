Their areas of focus are:
Solidifying culture by establishing meaning and purpose via shared Jupiverse identities and ethos
Formation of social capital through regular & consistent community interactions, rituals of appreciation and mutual encouragement and support (including critical feedback)
Experimenting forward with different ways of living, working and playing in the Jupiverse

Members: Julz(lead), Catoshi(co-lead), Opacks, Cas and Rolex Gold

Budget/Ask: Full year, $462,000 USDC & 750,000 $JUP
