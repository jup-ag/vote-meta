This vote is for checking if the community is comfortable with 2 more Jupuaries of 700M JUP each.

Because it is crucial that the whole community is unified, the team will be seeking a 70% yes vote, and will spare no effort to get there.

If the vote does not pass, we will take your feedback, iterate on the proposal, and ask for a new vote.

Note: For this vote, you will be asked to leave your feedback after casting your vote.

The aim of Jupuary is to accelerate the growth of the community, massively decentralize the protocol, and through the entire process unify the entire community under a common vision â€“ that Jupiter has to be one of the key winners, Jupiverse has to be a cultural force, and JUP has to become one of the main tokens in the cryptoverse.

If the vote passes, the team will gain the certainty to plan and execute on the next 2 Jupuaries together with the community.
